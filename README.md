# Flutter_Game

A game in Flutter developed from scratch by me. It works as an RPG, where the field the player can freely walk on is a grid table. Each table holds an element that ranges from the image it contains, to the player itself, enemies, and some logic. Some enemies are fixed, while others chase the player through the nearest and fastest path without colliding with obstacles that block movement. When the player collides with an enemy, a battle screen opens, featuring a unique combat dynamic. It has a leveling system and several menus. I'm still in the early stages, but it's a secondary project, so I'll probably take some time to finish it.
